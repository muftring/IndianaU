Data Visualization   
Class: INFO I590   
Section: 14120 (online), 33510, 9363   
Instructor: Yong-Yeol Ahn   
Synopsis: From dashboards in a car to cutting-edge scientific papers, we extensively use visual representation of data. As our world becomes increasingly connected and digitized and as more decisions are being driven by data, data visualization is becoming a critical skill for every knowledge worker. In this course we will learn fundamentals of data visualization and create visualizations that can provide insights into complex datasets.

## 2018, Spring
Network Science   
Class: INFO I590   
Section: 14149, 32299 (Online)   
Instructor: Yong-Yeol Ahn   
Syllabus: View document   
Synopsis: Networks are everywhere. We can easily find network structure in many complex systems around us: our cells, brains, society, etc.The inherent generality of network approach allowed wide applications of network theory to flourish across diverse fields including biology, sociology, and epidemiology. The questions that we will address in the class are the following: Why do networks matter? What are the fundamental theories to understand the structure and dynamics of networks? How has it been applied to other fields? What are the frontiers of the research? We will explore key papers ranging from the fundamental theory to the various applications of network theory. This course will focus more on round-table discussion between students than presentation. Students will work on research projects in groups and finish a paper at the end of the class.

## 2018, Summer
Statistical Analysis for Effective Decision-Making   
Class: SPEA V506   
Section: 13796 (100% Online)   
Syllabus: Please request with Instructor   
Credits: 3   
Instructor: Joanna Woronkowicz   
Synopsis: An introduction to statistics. Nature of statistical data. Ordering and manipulation of data. Measures of central tendency and dispersion. Elementary probability. Concepts of statistical inference decision: estimation and hypothesis testing. Special topics discussed may include regression and correlation, analysis of variance, nonparametric methods. This course will provide an introduction to the analysis of quantitative data via statistical analyses. Topics covered include, but are not limited to, descriptive statistics, z-scores, probability, z-tests, t-tests, correlation, regression. The focus is on the practical interpretation and application of statistics.
